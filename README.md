Project Description
This project recreates the historic front page of the *Daily Jang* from 1977, reporting the imposition of Martial Law by General Zia-ul-Haq. The layout captures the dramatic political shift with a bold banner headline and a column layout that separates the deposed leadership from the new military administration.

Features Implemented
Complex Table Structure: Used a nested table layout to create the distinct 3-column look (Left Sidebar, Main Story, Right Feature).
Inline CSS Styling: Applied distinct borders (double, dashed, solid) to mimic the print separation lines used in old newspapers.
Semantic Tags: Utilized `<article>` for the main news report and `<figure>` for the image captions.
Typographic Hierarchy: Used uppercase `<h1>` for the "shouting" headline style typical of major breaking news.

 Challenges Faced
The main challenge was handling the varying heights of the columns. The left column (photos) needed to be narrow, while the center text needed more breathing room. I solved this by assigning specific percentage widths (`20%`, `50%`, `30%`) to the table cells.
